This module is not NasNet or AdaNet but something between of them. This model mainly has stolen or composed of
different AutoMl algorithms with the purpose to create own architecture and try me to figure out how this works.

Model works well if training steps above 100. All architecture is simple and perform light tasks. It`s something
like demo model. Now model uses QLearning agent but you can reach higher result with better RL methods. Also to improve
accuracy you should use assembly of NN for classifying process because medium value of accuracy will be more stable than
accuracy of single NN who`s train and test accuracy may be deviated in both direction.
